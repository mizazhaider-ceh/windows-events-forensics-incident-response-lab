## 📋 Lab Overview

This lab simulates a **post-breach investigation** where a Windows endpoint has been compromised. As a security analyst, you must analyze raw Windows Security Event Logs to reconstruct the complete attack timeline, identify the threat actor, and document evidence for incident response.

### Scenario

> *"A Windows system has been compromised. The security team has extracted the Security Event Log file (SecurityLog.evtx) before the attacker could cover their tracks. Your mission: reconstruct the entire attack from initial access to data exfiltration using only the Windows Event Viewer."*

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

### Digital Forensics
- Analyze Windows Security Event Logs (.evtx files)
- Distinguish between legitimate and malicious user activity
- Reconstruct attack timelines using log correlation
- Extract Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) from event metadata

### Incident Response
- Apply NIST 6-phase IR lifecycle
- Classify incidents using US-CERT and ENISA taxonomies
- Document evidence chain for legal/compliance purposes
- Make strategic IR decisions under pressure (extortion scenarios)

### Threat Hunting
- Identify privilege escalation techniques
- Detect lateral movement patterns
- Recognize persistence mechanisms (backdoor accounts)
- Trace network attribution data

---

# 🔍 INVESTIGATION PHASES

## Phase 1: Baseline Establishment

### Objective
Identify the **legitimate user** of the system to distinguish normal activity from attacker behavior.

### Methodology

**Event ID:** 4624 (Successful Logon)

**Target Time:** Early morning (first interactive logon of the day)

**Key Fields to Analyze:**
- **Logon Type:** Look for Type 2 (Interactive - physical keyboard)
- **Subject vs. New Logon:** 
  - Subject = System process handling the login
  - New Logon = **Actual user** logging in
- **Security ID (SID):** Unique identifier for the user account

### Analysis Checklist

```
□ Located Event ID 4624 with Logon Type 2
□ Identified Account Name under "New Logon" section
□ Extracted Security ID (format: S-1-5-21-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXXXX-XXXX)
□ Verified this is the first interactive login of the day
```

### Critical Finding

✅ **Baseline user identified** - All subsequent activity will be compared against this baseline.

---

## Phase 2: Breach Detection

### Objective
Identify **unauthorized system changes** indicating compromise.

### Methodology

**Event ID:** 4720 (User Account Created)

**Target Time:** Mid-morning (after legitimate user logged in)

**Key Fields to Analyze:**
- **Subject:** Who created the account? (Check if it's the legitimate user or SYSTEM)
- **New Account Name:** What is the name of the suspicious account?
- **Security ID:** New SID assigned to the created account

**Event ID:** 4732 (Member Added to Security-Enabled Local Group)

**Key Fields:**
- **Group Name:** Was the account added to "Administrators"?
- **Member SID:** Does it match the newly created account?

### Attack Pattern Recognition

This sequence indicates a **Persistence** technique:

```
Timeline of Compromise:
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
11:15:00 → Event 4720 (Account Created)
11:15:01 → Event 4722 (Account Enabled)
11:15:02 → Event 4724 (Password Reset)
11:15:03 → Event 4732 (Added to Administrators)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
```

### Analysis Checklist

```
□ Located Event ID 4720 (account creation)
□ Verified account was enabled immediately after creation
□ Confirmed account was added to Administrators group
□ Documented new account name and SID
□ Classified as Privilege Escalation + Persistence
```

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

**Tactic:** Persistence (TA0003)  
**Technique:** Create Account: Local Account (T1136.001)  
**Sub-Technique:** Add user to Administrators group for elevated privileges

---

## Phase 3: Attack Execution

### Objective
Determine **how the attacker accessed** the compromised system.

### Methodology

**Event ID:** 4624 (Successful Logon)

**Target Time:** Shortly after account creation (~11:36)

**Target Account:** The newly created malicious account

**Critical Analysis: Logon Type Classification**

| Logon Type | Description | Attack Context |
|------------|-------------|----------------|
| **2** | Interactive | Local keyboard/screen access |
| **3** | Network | File share or printer access |
| **10** | RemoteInteractive | **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** |

### Network Forensics

**Key Fields in Event 4624:**
- **Network Information Section:**
  - Workstation Name
  - **Source Network Address** (Attacker's IP)
  - Source Port
- **Detailed Authentication:**
  - Logon Process (e.g., User32, NtLmSsp)
  - Authentication Package (NTLM, Kerberos)

### Analysis Checklist

```
□ Filtered Event ID 4624 for malicious account name
□ Identified Logon Type 10 (RDP) and/or Type 3 (Network)
□ Extracted Source Network Address (attacker's IP)
□ Noted timestamp of first malicious login
□ Documented authentication method (NTLM vs Kerberos)
```

### Attack Vector Identification

✅ **Primary Vector:** Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)  
✅ **Secondary Vector:** Network share access (SMB/CIFS)  
✅ **Attribution:** External IP address identified

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

**Tactic:** Initial Access (TA0001) / Lateral Movement (TA0008)  
**Technique:** Remote Services: Remote Desktop Protocol (T1021.001)  
**Technique:** Remote Services: SMB/Windows Admin Shares (T1021.002)

---

## Phase 4: Lateral Movement & Exfiltration

### Objective
Trace attacker's **post-exploitation activity** and identify data theft.

### Methodology

**Event ID:** 4648 (Logon Attempted Using Explicit Credentials)

**What This Means:**
- User A is logged in
- User A attempts to access a resource **as User B**
- Common in:
  - `runas` command
  - Mapping network drives with alternate credentials
  - **Lateral movement to another server**

**Key Fields:**
- **Subject:** Currently logged-in user (the attacker's account)
- **Account Whose Credentials Were Used:** Different account (e.g., "guest")
- **Target Server Name:** Remote system being accessed
- **Network Address:** Destination IP

**Event ID:** 5140 (Network Share Object Accessed)

**What This Means:**
- A file share (e.g., `\\server\backup`) was accessed
- Useful for identifying data exfiltration attempts

### Analysis Checklist

```
□ Located Event 4648 within ~1 minute of malicious login
□ Identified Target Server Name (storage infrastructure)
□ Noted which credentials were used (guest, service account, etc.)
□ Checked for Event 5140 (share access) to confirm file operations
□ Documented accessed share paths
```

### Evidence of Exfiltration

✅ **Target Server:** Storage infrastructure identified  
✅ **Method:** Explicit credential logon to remote server  
✅ **Timeline:** Occurred within minutes of initial access  
✅ **Risk:** Potential data theft confirmed

### MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

## Subject vs. New Logon (Event 4624)

### Common Confusion

```
Event ID 4624 - Successful Logon

Subject:
  Security ID:      S-1-5-18 (SYSTEM)
  Account Name:     COMPUTER-NAME$
  Account Domain:   WORKGROUP
  Logon ID:         0x3E7

New Logon:
  Security ID:      S-1-5-21-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-1000
  Account Name:     User
  Account Domain:   COMPUTER-NAME
  Logon ID:         0x13C89
```

**❌ WRONG:** The user is "SYSTEM"  
**✅ CORRECT:** The user is "User" (SID ending in -1000)

**Explanation:**
- **Subject** = The Windows component that **processed** the login (e.g., winlogon.exe running as SYSTEM)
- **New Logon** = The **actual user account** that was logged in

---

## Security Identifier (SID) Structure

```
S-1-5-21-705428713-1283917362-25449821-1000
│ │ │  │                                 └─> RID (Relative Identifier)
│ │ │  └─────────────────────────────────────> Domain/Computer Identifier
│ │ └────────────────────────────────────────> NT Authority
│ └──────────────────────────────────────────> Revision (always 1)
└────────────────────────────────────────────> SID Identifier Authority
```

**Common RIDs:**
- **500** → Local Administrator account
- **501** → Guest account
- **1000+** → User-created accounts

**Forensic Value:**
- SIDs **never change** (even if username is changed)
- Use SID to **track the same user** across different events

---

## Event ID Reference (Security Log)

| Event ID | Description | Forensic Value |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| **4608** | Windows Starting Up | Establishes system boot timeline |
| **4624** | Successful Logon | Primary event for tracking access |
| **4625** | Failed Logon | Detects brute force attempts |
| **4648** | Logon Using Explicit Credentials | Lateral movement, privilege escalation |
| **4672** | Special Privileges Assigned | Admin/SYSTEM privilege use |
| **4720** | User Account Created | Persistence mechanism detection |
| **4722** | User Account Enabled | Account activation |
| **4724** | Password Reset Attempt | Credential tampering |
| **4732** | Member Added to Group | Privilege escalation |
| **4740** | Account Lockout | Failed authentication tracking |
| **5140** | Network Share Accessed | Data exfiltration evidence |
| **5145** | Detailed File Share Audit | Specific file access tracking |
| **1102** | Audit Log Cleared | Anti-forensics / log tampering |
